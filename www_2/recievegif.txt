To recieve a gif, from the given data in the push request we just form a url and 
do a simple image get request from the server.
Once this is complete we can send an ackrequest to server to give it the ability to delete it.
And one it is seen by the user, we can also delete it.
So for for ten pust notifications recieved, we run 10 seperate threads one after the other 
which will get those images. And then we delete the image once the user has seen it once, if the delete flag is set.

Hence we need to send to the reciever phone the following things
*systimestamp
*sender user

using this two and its own IEMI, it will from an url, which it will use to get the image

the phone must have following tables
1.friends list
2.transfer

friends list-> username,userid,status(this status will hold 'ofline','online')
transfer -> username , systimestamp, 
is used to sort and list the friends on the send page.
